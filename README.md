# The Tower Game

This was my second project that I created while during my time in Coding Dojo(full-stack software development coding bootcamp) after the C#/.NET Core stack. I decided to challenge myself to learn Unity 2D and build a game inspired by Castlevania. It is deployed on this [link](https://sharemygame.com/@michelletanzil/the-tower-game). To learn Unity and build this game took 9 days.

## Features

- The player can run, jump, kill enemies, be killed by enemies and/or hazards.
- The player can also pause the game, restart the game, and navigate back to the start menu.
- A total of 3 game levels with increasing difficulty was made.

## Technologies

- Unity 2D
- C#

## Credits

- Game art and sprites were taken from [OpenGameArt.Org](https://opengameart.org/)
